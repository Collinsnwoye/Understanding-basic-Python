  ## Variables
I see it as a name given a value, call it the container's name. You can gave a Variable different names in this sense :

```python 
# I'm wealthy thats who I am.
Collins = "I'm wealthy thats who I am."

# School friends call me Brown
Brown = Collins

# Colleagues at work call me Collinzo 
Collinzo = Brown 

# I stopped using my name and name given to me by my school friends
del Collins
del Brown

# But colleagues nickname to me still refers to me.
print(Collinzo)
